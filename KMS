Most important data 

- create and  control encryption keys 
- is intengreated wiht other AWS services , Amazon Work Emaik, RDS, EBC S3

CMK Customer Mseter Key
- alias
- creation date
- description
- key state
- key material (either cumore proveded or AWS provided) - can never be exproted
Two types CMK done by KMS or Custoem by open ssl

Setup a Customer Master Key
- create alias and description
- Choose material option
- Define Key Administrative Permissions
	- IAMusers/roles tha can administer(but not use) the key through the KMS API)
- Define Key Usage Permissions 
	- IAM user/roles tha tcan use the key to encrypt and decrypt data. 
	


Why import your own key material:
- Prove that randommess meets your requriments (Compilande)
- Extend your exisign prosses to AWS
	-To be able to delete key material without a 7-30 days wait. Then be able to import them again
- To be resilient to AWS failure by storing keys outside AWS.*
- 


How to import your own key material:
- create CMK wiht no key material
- Download a public key (wrapping key ) and import token
- Encrypt the key material
- Import the key material 


COSIDERATION FOR IMPORTED KEY MATERIALS
- Awailability and durability is different 
- Secure key generation is up to you
- No automatic rotation
- Ciphertexts are not portable betweekn CMKs

WE CANNOT USE KMS TO GENERATE KEY PAIS(PRIVATE/PUBLIC) TO EC2

We can import Pulic Key into EC2 Key Pairs, but we cannot use EC2 Key Pairs to encrypt EBS volume, we must use KMS or third party application/tools. 

We can use KMS to encrypt EBS volumes and it is possible to encrypt root device volume

To encrypt root device volume create an AMI. The initial AMI will be unencrypted, but you can then copy it and in doing so ecrypt it.

You can change ecnryption keys from amazon managed to customer master key.

you can copy from one region to another and makes these copies encrypted, but you MUST use kes in the destination region to do the encryption.

You can view the public key by going to .ssh/authroized_keys
You can also view the public key ussing the EC2 instace metadata
curl http://169/254/169/254/lates/meta-data/poulic-keys/0/openssh-key

You can have multiple public keys attached to an EC2 intance

You can now add role to existing EC2 instances.


Deleting Key Pail in the console will not delete form the instaces meta data.

If you lose a KP (Pulblic/Private), take a snapshot fo the EC2 instace and the deploy it as a new instance. 
This will append a new public key to authorized_keys


Beause you cannot export keys from KMS and because the Amazon is involded in the generation of the key, you cannot use the KMS wiht SSH for EC2.
With Cloud HSM you can however because you can export keys from Cloud HSM


WAF 3 behaviours:

allows all requests except ones that you specify
block all requests except ones that you specify
Count all requests that match the properties that you specify

What we can block
- IP that requested orginate from
- Cuntry that requested orginate from 
- Values in the reques header 
- String that appers in requests / strings that match regular expression( patterns)
- Lenght of request
- Presence of SQL code
- Presence XSS code


Application Load Balancers integreated with WAF at the regional level,
 and Cloudfron at the GLOBAL LEVEL.

You need to associated your rules to AWS resources in order to be able to make it work

You can use WAF to protec sites no hosted in AWS via Cloud Front . CloudFront supports custom orgin outside of AWS. ipv4/ipv6 supported. ip blocker for /8/16/24/32


AWS SHIELD 
Turned ON by default
3000$/month  if you want advanced options.

Advanced options give you an incident reponse team in depth reportin
You will not pay if you victim of the attack.


DEDICATED ISNTACE AND DEDICATED HOST

both have dedicated hardware
If you have specific regulatory requriments or licensing conditios, choose dedicated host.
Dedicated instances can share the same hardware with other AWS isntaces from the SAME account that are NOT dedicated
Dedicated hosts give you much better visibility in to things like sockets cores and hsots.


	HYPERVIORS
Choose the HVM over PV where possible
PV is isolated by layers
Only AWS Administrator have access to hypervisor
All stored memory and RAM is scrubbed before is delivered to you.
